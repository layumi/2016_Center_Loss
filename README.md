# Center_Loss
Idea is from [A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition ECCV16](http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf)
The author's code can be find in following links:
[caffe](https://github.com/kpzhang93/caffe-face)
[mxnet](https://github.com/pangyupo/mxnet_center_loss)


I rebuild the code based on Matconvnet.
